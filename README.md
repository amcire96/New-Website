# New-Website

This is my new/modern website.

Rather than painfully coding with html and styling with css like I did in my first website, I used Bootstrap. 

On my page, there is a carousel with the projects that I have done. 
There's a short description of each project and pictures if the user presses the "more info' button.
In addition, there is an About Me section, a Resume and Code section, and a Contact Me section
